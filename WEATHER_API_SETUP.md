### Step 3: Get Your API Key

1. After logging in, go to [https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
2. You'll see a default API key already created
3. Copy the API key (looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`)
4. Or create a new API key:
   - Enter a name for your key (e.g., "KRISHI MITHRA")
   - Click **"Generate"**
   - Copy the newly generated key

### Step 4: Add API Key to Your Application

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

3. Open the `.env` file in a text editor

4. Find these lines:
   ```
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=demo_key
   WEATHER_API_KEY=demo_key
   ```

5. Replace `demo_key` with your actual API key:
   ```
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
   WEATHER_API_KEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
   ```

6. Save the file

### Step 5: Restart the Server

1. Stop the server if it's running (press `Ctrl+C` in terminal)
2. Start the server again:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

- Humidity, wind speed, and pressure
- Weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)

### 2. **Accurate 7-Day Forecast**
- Daily high/low temperatures

## Testing the Weather API

After setting up the API key, test it:

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/testWeatherAPI.js
```

This will:
- Verify your API key is working
- Show sample weather data
- Confirm the connection to OpenWeatherMap

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid API Key"
**Solution:** 
- Wait 10-15 minutes after creating a new API key (activation time)
- Check that you copied the entire key without spaces
- Verify the key in your OpenWeatherMap dashboard

### Issue: "API Key Expired"
**Solution:**
- Free API keys don't expire
- Check if your account is still active
- Generate a new API key if needed

### Issue: "Too Many Requests"
**Solution:**
- You've exceeded 60 calls/minute
- Wait a minute and try again
- Consider caching weather data in production

### Issue: Weather still showing demo data
**Solution:**
- Make sure you saved the `.env` file
- Restart the server after changing `.env`
- Check console logs for any errors
- Verify the API key has no extra spaces or quotes

## Demo Mode

If you don't set up an API key, the application will run in **demo mode**:
- Shows sample weather data
- Works offline
- Good for testing UI/functionality
- Not suitable for production use

## Production Recommendations

For production deployment:

1. **Use Environment Variables:** Store API key in server environment variables, not in `.env` file
2. **Enable Caching:** Cache weather data for 15-30 minutes to reduce API calls
3. **Error Handling:** Gracefully fallback to cached data if API is unavailable
4. **Monitor Usage:** Keep track of API calls in OpenWeatherMap dashboard
5. **Consider Upgrade:** If you exceed free tier limits, consider paid plans
