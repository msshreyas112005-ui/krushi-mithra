## 🔒 API Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit** API keys to version control
2. **Use .env** files (already in .gitignore)
3. **Rate limit** API calls (implemented)
4. **Cache responses** to minimize calls (6-hour cache)
5. **Monitor usage** to stay within free tier limits

---

## 🆓 Using Demo Mode

If you don't have API keys yet, the application works in demo mode:

- ✅ Demo weather data with realistic values
- ✅ Demo market prices from Karnataka markets
- ✅ All features fully functional
- ✅ Great for development and testing

Just leave the keys as `demo_key` in your `.env` file.
